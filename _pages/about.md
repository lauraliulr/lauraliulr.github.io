I am pursuing Ph.D degree in quantum computing and information, focusing on the development of quantum
cryptographic schemes via Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete problems, in particular, the quantum
marginal problem or the consistency of local density matrices.

Before transitioning into the physics community, I engaged in interdisciplinary work spanning architecture,
finance, and other fields. I highly value intellectual exchanges with experts across disciplines and actively seek
to broaden my perspectives.

I am multilingualâ€”fluent in Mandarin, English, Japanese, and Cantonese and is
currently studying French.
