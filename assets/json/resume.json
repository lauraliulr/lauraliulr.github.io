    "summary": "I am pursuing a Ph.D. in quantum computing and information with a focus on developing novel quantum cryptographic schemes via QMA‐complete problems – particularly the quantum marginal problem (consistency of local density matrices). With an interdisciplinary background spanning architecture, finance, and other fields, I value intellectual exchanges across diverse disciplines. I am fluent in Mandarin, English, Japanese, and Cantonese and am currently studying French.",
